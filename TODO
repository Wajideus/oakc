- The printing functions in syntax.c/syntax.h will eventually be removed. They
  only exist for testing purposes to ensure that the syntax tree is being
  formatted properly, and to test how a code generator should decend the tree.

- The AST building functions need to be implemented and used by parser.y.

- Error logging functionality needs to be added to the parser.

- An LLVM emitter needs to be written.
