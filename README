The Oak programming language aims to be a simple non-dogmatic improvement on
the C programming language.


1.  Function calls do not require parentheses unless you're capturing their
    return value.

        puts "Hello World!";


2.  Expressions are not statements.

        die;

    This allows functions with no arguments to be called without parentheses.


3.  Assignments are not expressions.

        var entity Entity = {
            position = Vec3.ZERO
        }
        move entity, toLocation="hello world\n";
    
    This allows for struct initialiizers and function calls to support the
    assignment of a field or parameter by name.


4.  Conditions are not expressions, and must be wrapped in parentheses if they
    aren't part of an "if" or "while" statement.

        if printStuff == TRUE {
            printf "%b\n", (this != that);
        }

    This is one of the requirements for supporting tuples in the language.


5.  All type definitions begin with "typedef".

        typedef struct Entity {
            var position Vec3;
        }
    
    This just makes the language more consistent.


6.  There's a "mixin" modifier.

        typedef struct Monster {
            mixin entity Entity;
            aggro Float;
        }

        var monster Monster;
        monster.position = Vec3.ZERO;   // monster.entity.position
    
    This saves a lot of typing and allows for structural polymorphism.


7.  The '.' operator works on pointers.

        var monster *Monster = alloc(Monster);
        monster.aggro = 0.75;
        
    This makes working with deep hierarchies less painful.


8.  The '*', '/', '%', '&', '<<', and '>>' operators all have the same
    precedence; and the '+', '-', '|', and '^' operators all have the
    precedence. The '&&' operator also has a higher precedence than '||'.

    This helps to prevent bugs caused by confusing operator precedence.


9.  Pointers are dereferenced by default, so there's no need for references.
    This allows you to use operators on an object without having to
    dereference it. Conversion between lvalues and lvalue pointers can be
    done implicitly, which reduces noise in the program. Lvalue pointers,
    unlike references in C++, are nullable.


10. Multiple comma-separated includes can by done at once.

        include "stdio", "stdlib";

    This just saves some typing.


11. There's a built-in length-prefixed immutable "str" string type.

        const text Str = "Hello World";
        print text;

    This allows you to compare strings with '==' and '!=', and boosts the
    performance of string operations by utilizing string interning, length
    comparison, and vectorized operations. It also allows strings to contain
    null bytes, which is useful for storing things like bytecode.


12. There's a built-in unsigned int type called "uint".

        const x UInt = 5;
    
    Typing "unsigned" is obnoxious.


13. The "Bool" type is built-in, so you don't have to include "stdbool.h".


14. There's a built-in dictionary type called "Dict", which is implemented as
    a chained scatter table.

        var person Dict;
        person.name = "bob";
        person.age = 26;
        print person["age"];

    A chained scatter table is extremely efficient and is a fundamental tool
    for solving a large class of problems.


15. There [will be] a built-in variant type called "any".

    This is necessary to support dictionaries in the language. It also gives
    the illusion of dynamic typing.

16. There's support for type inference.

        var file = fopen("test.txt", "rb");

17. There are 'defer' statements, which are executed in reverse order when
    the function ends.

        defer fclose(file);
        ...

    This allows recovering from multiple error vectors via state reversal.


18. There's support for tuples.

        x, y = 2, 4;
        if x, y == 2, 4 {
            ...
        }
    
    This is particularly useful for things like swapping operations.


19. There's support for proper modules instead of header files.


20. There's support for order-independent declarations.


21. There's support for function overloading.


22. There's support for initial struct values.


23. There's support for breaking and continuing labelled loops.

        copying:
          while line = readline(file) {
              if line.isEmpty {
                  break copying;
              }
          }


24. You can change the location of the stack.


25. The 'func' keyword is a modifier used for function declarations in order
    to prevent them from being reassigned and make them easily greppable.


26. There's a "Proc" (process) type for coroutines.

        func dostuff() Proc {
            ...
        }

        func main(args[] Str) Int {
            var doingstuff Proc = dostuff();
            while doingstuff {
                ...
            }
        }


27. A cast from "T()" to "T" is done implicitly via function call.

        func text() Str {
            return "Hello World!";
        }

        print text;
    
    This just removes some line noise.



While the Oak programming language does make a lot of things less cumbersome
and error-prone than they would be in C, it doesn't necessarily raise the
level of abstraction. You're still responsible for memory and control flow.

The focus of the language's design is semantic compression. Idioms that are
encouraged by the language will typically have a shorthand notation.
